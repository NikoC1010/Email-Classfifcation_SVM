# Email-Classfifcation_SVM
This project focuses on classifying emails as spam or non-spam using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel.  During the preprocessing phase, we employed stemming for text normalization. The model was implemented using SVC,  and we visualized the top words associated with different classifications. The model's performance was evaluated using  the Area Under the Curve (AUC), achieving an impressive score of 0.99.
Refer to my file code for more details on preprocessing.
